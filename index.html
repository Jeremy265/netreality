				<h1>What is net neutrality ?</h1>
				<div class="definition">
					<p>Net neutrality is the idea that Internet service providers such as AT&T, Verizon Wireless or T-Mobile should treat equally all online traffic running through their network. Big companies such as Netflix or Google don’t get special treatment. With net neutrality, for instance, Google doesn’t run faster than your grandmother’s blog.

					<p>Without net neutrality, let’s imagine that you want to watch a video on Youtube. If you didn’t subscribe to a bundle that includes Youtube via your ISP, either you cannot even go on Youtube, or in the best case, you can’t see the video with a quality higher than 144p with a very low connection.
