		<p style="font-weight:bold; font-size: larger;">We are NetReality an organization campaigning for the preservation of net neutrality.</p><br>
		<div class ="about" style="font-size: larger;">
		
		But what is net neutrality? Well, it's very simple, net neutrality is the idea that Internet service providers such as Comcast, 
		SFR or Free should treat equally all online traffic running through their network. Big companies such as Netflix or Google don’t get special treatment. 
		Because of net neutrality, for instance, Google doesn’t run faster than your grandmother’s blog.<br>
		But right now Net neutrality is at risk, lobbies and Internet Service Providers are trying to kill it, all of that for their own profit. This is why we need your help
		to spread awareness about this matter, because it concerns you as much as any other web user.<br>
		If you wish to help us directly you can donate to our campaign via the "join the fight" page, you don't have to but it can help make the difference.
